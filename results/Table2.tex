\multicolumn{8}{p{20cm}}{\footnotesize Note: Column (1) reports mean and standard deviation of each variable stated in the first column. Column (2) reports the OLS coefficients estimates of military presence over each variable stated in the first column, by using the logarithmic distance to the closest military facility as independent variable. Column (3) reports the OLS coefficients estimates of military presence over each variable stated in the first column while including control variables. Panel A uses county-level variables, its selected control variables are province fixed effects, population in 1970, urban share in 1970, logarithmic distance to Santiago and to the regional capital, and the vote shares obtained by Allende and Alessandri in the 1970 elections, and report Conley standard error in parentheses. Panel B uses area-level variables, its selected control variables are population and urban share in 1970, county-population weighted logarithmic distances to Santiago and to he regional capital, and the vote shares obtained by Allende and Alessandri in the 1970 election, and report robust standard error in parentheses. All observations are weighted by 1970 county or area population size, correspondingly.}\\
