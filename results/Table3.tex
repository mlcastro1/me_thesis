\hline\hline \multicolumn{9}{p{25cm}}{\footnotesize * p$<$0.05, ** p$<$0.01, *** p$<$0.001. Note: Unit of observation: county. This Table reports OLS coefficient estimates of military presence before 1973 over state repression during the dictatorship, by using the logarithmic distance to the closest military facility as independent variable. Dependent variables are the number of fatal victims per 1,000 inhabitants (columns (1) and (2)), a dummy indicating any victims (columns (3) and (4)), a dummy indicating any detention centers (columns (5) and (6)), and the logarithmic of the number of detention centers plus one (columns (7) and (8)). Even-numbered columns include province fixed effects, and control for population in 1970, urban share in 1970, logarithmic distance to Santiago and to the regional capital, and the vote shares obtained by Allende and Alessandri in the 1970 elections. Note that missing values in the control variables are imputed with the sample mean, and indicator variables for these cases are added as controls. Observations are weighted by 1970 county population size. Conley standard errors in parentheses.}\\ \end{tabular} } % Generated on 18 Sep 2023 at 22:27:59.
